# JohnnyFroggyVsTheInvaders
This demo is a simulation of a single wave of enemies in Johnny Froggy vs The Invaders. It starts off where you as the player have to set down 3 cannons in whatever position you feel is best to protect your house. The green orb on the map will indicate where the cannon will be placed. You will have to hold Aim before selecting a location to let the game know you intend to put a canon there. Once that is done, combat will begin. Once combat starts you will be able to mount cannons and aim your whistle attack. Enemies will try to get into your house, and each one that makes it there will damage your house’s health. If the house’s health reaches 0, it’s game over. Survive the wave of enemies and you win. Press ESC to exit the game after the round or at any time.
